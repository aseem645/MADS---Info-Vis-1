    "On account of the manageable number of variables and encodings - namely, emoji, percentage, and ranking - it is more than feasible to refactor the horizontal bar chart pictured above as a circle chart. The nominal variable 'emoji' can be encoded on the x-axis, while percentage can be encoded on the y-axis and in label form above/adjacent to each point, while rank can be encoded by overlaying text over each circle and in the position of each emoji on the x-axis. Converting the bar chart to a circle chart with this likeness would not be less expressive than 538's bar chart - for, all of the necessary facts in the dataset needed to convey the desired message have been represented, and only these facts. Nor would this alteration be less effective, since the information conveyed here is not less readily perceived than the information conveyed in 538's chart. In regards to Tufte's data-ink ratio, it could be argued that the quotient obtained from the calculation(data ink ratio = data ink/total ink used to render the entire graphic) will decrease with the circle chart approach, since the ink utilized to represent the data itself will naturally decrease(circles use less ink than filled bars), and thereby the total ink used to render the entire graphic will also decrease. Superfluous chart junk is not present in either approach, and proportionality is not a great concern with the circle chart approach, since the sizes of each point are uniform, though it is easier to create bars with erroneous proportions with the horizontal bar plot approach. All this being said, the clear and concise labeling possible with both approaches can make up for any potential graphical distortion, of which there could be a potential for depending on the visualization framework being utilized."

    "Although the above visualization is eye catching and memorable, it does suffer from some excess chart junk. The two images of Muhammad Ali could have been removed, for instance, in addition to the image of his downed opponent, the boxing gloves in the upper right corner, and the boxing gloves surrounding Ali's victory/loss totals - though the numerical text can retain the color encoding, so the viewer can differentiate between wins/losses. Indeed, the viewer will almost certainly be able to infer that the chart pertains to the boxer Muhammad Ali on account of the visualization's title, making these extra images - though striking - somewhat superfluous. Once these items have been removed, the visualization will be in a state where all of the components are the minimum number necessary in order communicate what it is intending to in a manner that is still understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this being said, it is possible to refactor the visualization entirely, and may even be the prudent choice, since the quasi-pie chart nature of the visualization makes the numerous labels difficult to read. Instead, a stacked bar chart can be utilized, with year on the y-axis, and the number of wins/losses Ali experienced for a certain year stacked on top of each other. The names of Ali's opponents can be overlayed each bar as text, and the color encoding for wins/losses can be retained. The legend that displays the type of win/loss can be retained as well, within the whitespace next to the chart."

    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "For the nearly 15,000 people in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, and the millions more huddled around TVs across the world, the Floyd Mayweather–Conor McGregor fight was a roller coaster of emotions. They were anxious as pay-per-view [technical problems](http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20469815/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-delay-ppv-problems) pushed back the fight’s start. They were full of anticipation when the combatants finally emerged after months of hype. They were surprised when McGregor held his own, or seemed to hold his own, for a couple of rounds. They were thrilled when Mayweather finally started fighting. And they were exhausted by the end.\n",

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."

    "For my proposed alternative, I attempted to emulate my hand-drawn sketch to the best of my ability using altair, as an alternative to the very first visualization we created(538's horizontal bar chart). I believe that this approach would be a perfectly viable alternative to 538's chart, and may arguably be a superior one, on account of the fact that the three variables are encoded more naturally, instead of in a forced tabular form. The ranking of each emoji is annotated next to each point, and is also implicit in the ordering of each emoji on the x-axis, while percentage is encoded on the y-axis. In regards to Tufte's data-in ratio, less ink is undoubtedly used to represent the data using this approach, and thereby less ink overall. There is virtually no chart junk here, and graphical integrity is not difficult to ensure, as the overall readability can be adjusted simply by altering the width of the graph. It is equally as expressive as 538's chart(all of the necessary data and only that data is displayed), and is equally as effective in terms of interpreting the primary message(ranking of each emoji).

It could feasibly be argued that percentages, on their own, are not very useful in regards to referring information about the underlying data if the underlying magnitude of said percentage is not known. In other words, 25% of 2000 observations, vs. 25% of 25 observations, are drastically different in their magnitude, and have signifiantly different implications in the real world, depending on the domain. In lieu of actually disclosing the total number of emojis tweeted during the fight(never given in 538's article), I felt that the next best thing to do in order to enable the viewer to glean a better understanding of the magnitude of the data they are interpreting would be to simply visualize some hard totals.\n",

    "It would have been possible to display this exact data using a scatter plot if one were driven solely by Tufte's data-ink rationale, but those are more fit for comparison purposes rather than exemplifying magnitude, both of which can be handled by bar charts. The chart is devoid of superfluous chart-junk, and is adequately expressive enough to get across its intended message(total count of each emoji). There truly isn't a reasonably devisable alternative that wouldn't introduce needless complexity, thereby causing the visualization to be less effective. \n",
